        The displayed graph shows the interview findings. The x-axis represents the participants, while the y-axis quantifies the amount of mentions each topic. Each participant's bar is segmented into colour-coded sections, representing one of the seven key topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The research unveiled a spectrum of insights related to note-taking, technology, and AI. Participants demonstrated diverse note-taking strategies, ranging from digital to handwritten notes, underscoring the need for versatile solutions. There was a universal openness to embracing technology, but the extent and type of its application varied widely among participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the potential benefits of AI were recognised, there was a palpable level of scepticism and concerns about its reliability and ethical ramifications. These concerns are reflective of broader societal attitudes toward AI, which future technological solutions must address. Different organisational and storage strategies were employed by participants, suggesting a demand for robust and customisable organisational features in any prospective solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility emerged as a pivotal issue, encompassing not just the ease of initial storage but also the long-term retrieval and archiving of notes. Cloud storage was a common solution but was not universally used, with data security being a significant concern. The varying levels of comfort and familiarity with technology among participants could potentially introduce bias in the findings, emphasising the need for solutions that are inclusive and cater to different levels of tech-savviness.
      </p>
  
      <h3>3.1.3. Critical Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        While the interviews provided valuable insights, there are several areas that warrant critical evaluation. First, the limited scope of the interviews, focusing only on students and professionals in specific fields, may not capture the full range of experiences and challenges faced by individuals in other disciplines or life stages. Second, the interviews were conducted online, which, although convenient, may not offer the same depth of interaction and observation as face-to-face interviews. This could potentially limit the richness of the qualitative data collected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another point of critique is the varying levels of familiarity and comfort with technology among the interviewees. While some are well-versed in using advanced tools and AI, others are more conservative in their technology use. This disparity could introduce a bias in the findings, as those less comfortable with technology might not see the potential benefits of AI in note-taking to the same extent as their tech-savvy counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the interviews revealed that while there is general openness to the idea of integrating AI into note-taking, there is also significant scepticism and concern about its reliability, ethical implications, and potential to replace human roles. These reservations could be indicative of broader societal attitudes toward AI, which any future technology solutions would need to address.
      </p>
  
      <h3>3.1.4. Summary and Key Insights</h3>

            <td>Openness to AI in Note-Taking and Data Management</td>
            <td>While participants see the potential benefits of AI, there is also a level of scepticism and concern about its reliability and ethical implications.</td>
            <td>Yes</td>

      <h3>3.1.5. Implications for the Paper Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        The key findings from the interviews have several implications for the design of the paper prototype, which aims to create a tool for visualising text information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diverse visualisation strategies:</strong> Given the range of note-taking methods and organisational strategies employed by participants, the prototype should offer multiple ways to visualise text information. This could include mind maps, flowcharts, or hierarchical diagrams to cater to different preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>User-guided organisation:</strong> Since participants have different strategies for organising their notes, the prototype should allow users to manually organise visual elements. This would enable them to create visualisations that align with their individual organisational methods.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-assisted insights:</strong> Considering the cautious optimism about AI, the prototype could offer AI-assisted features that help in generating insights or summaries from the visualised text. However, users should have the option to customise or opt-out of these AI features.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency and ethics:</strong> In light of concerns about the reliability and ethical implications of AI, the prototype should make its algorithms transparent and offer opt-in features for data sharing or AI assistance. This would help in building trust and ethical compliance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By incorporating these elements, the paper prototype aims to be a user-centric tool that not only aids in visualising text information but also addresses the varying needs and concerns of the users. This approach ensures that the prototype is aligned with the real-world challenges and opportunities identified through the interviews.
