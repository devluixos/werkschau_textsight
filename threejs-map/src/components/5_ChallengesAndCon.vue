        While many useful insights emerged from the different prototypes and interviews, there are still aspects of the project that are uncertain. The user navigation depends on the structure of the data. While the general structure and functionality have been explored in Chapter 3.3 and 3.4, it is still not a finished concept and will have to improve with further tests.

        The visualisations have mostly been conceptual or static. While the structure and presentation have been examined, the actual development will pose different challenges with the creation of the visual elements themselves.

        A long list of abbreviations that represent the AI models have been tested in simple prototypes and environments. The actual process of the combination of them remains theoretical. From the NLP analysis of the text up to the LLM exploration to create the text metadata, the full processing chain is subject to be built, explored and tested.
