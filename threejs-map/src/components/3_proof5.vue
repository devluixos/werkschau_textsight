      <h3>Implications for the next Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        The implications for the subsequent prototype are a combination of the insights and reflections gathered from the user interactions and technical explorations conducted. They serve as pointers, highlighting the areas that require refinement and enhancement to align the prototype more closely with user needs and expectations. The pointers also try to address the identified technical and interaction shortcomings. These implications are instrumental in shaping the design and developmental approach for the next iteration of the prototype.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus on advanced visualisations:</strong> The next iteration must delve deeper into sophisticated and diverse visualisation strategies to meet the varied and advanced user expectations. A shift from the 'one node per text' visualisation to more dynamic and interactive visual elements is imperative. This includes exploring varied forms of visual representations like grouped topics or locations, allowing users to gain more profound insights into the text connections and interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Development of a digital mock-up:</strong> Given the need for more refined visualisations and functionalities, developing the next prototype as a digital mock-up is crucial. This approach allows for a detailed exploration and testing of design concepts, interaction models, and visual strategies without the complexities of full-scale programming. It ensures a user-centric design approach, enabling iterative refinement based on user feedback and preferences, aligning the solutions more closely with user needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploration of innovative solutions:</strong> The flexibility afforded by a digital mock-up provides a conducive environment for experimenting with innovative design concepts and interaction models. It is essential to leverage this flexibility to explore and integrate new functionalities and enhancements that can address the identified gaps and optimise user interaction and satisfaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced user-centric design:</strong> The next prototype should emphasise a more user-aligned design, focusing on intuitive interaction flows and user-friendly design elements. The design should prioritise ease of use and accessibility, offering clear guidelines and structured prompts to aid users during initial interactions, while maintaining adaptability to accommodate diverse user approaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile and customisable functionalities:</strong> The prototype needs to offer a range of customisable and transparent functionalities, allowing users to tailor the system to their individual needs and preferences. Emphasising functionalities that offer versatility and customisation is crucial for enhancing user experience and satisfaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Refinement in technical robustness:</strong> A deeper exploration into the developmental capabilities and constraints of the chosen technologies is crucial. Gaining more in-depth knowledge and insights into the developmental tools, methodologies, and practices used is fundamental for refining the developmental approach and enhancing the overall technical proficiency of the prototype.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These implications are important for the refinement and advancement of the prototype. The focus should be on addressing the real-world challenges and needs identified, ensuring the developed system is versatile, user-centric, and reflective of diverse user preferences and strategies.
