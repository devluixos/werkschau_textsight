      <h4>Probability Score Definition and Implementation</h4>
      <p>
        In text analysis, a probability score represents the likelihood or confidence level of a certain outcome or prediction. It is pivotal in various natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, or spam detection. The score typically ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low probability or confidence, and 1 signifies high probability or confidence. For instance, in sentiment analysis, a probability score of 0.8 for positive sentiment implies an 80% chance that the analysed text expresses positive sentiment (Qualtrics, 2023).

      <h4>Detailed Implementation</h4>
      <p>
        To implement a probability score in this context, the aim is to quantify the interconnectedness and relationships within texts. The process involves:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Text analysis:</strong> Extracting significant elements like named entities, keywords, and topics from the text using advanced NLP techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship analysis:</strong> Evaluating the depth of relationships and nuances of connections between extracted elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithm development:</strong> Designing algorithms to calculate the probability score based on the analysed relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Conducting thorough validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the calculated probability score.</li>
      </ol>
