      <h4>Zettelkasten by Niklas Luhmann</h4>
      <p>
        The Zettelkasten method, conceived by Niklas Luhmann, is a sophisticated system for knowledge management that involves creating "Zettels," or atomic notes, for individual pieces of information (Tietze, 2013). Each Zettel is a self-contained unit of knowledge but is also linked to other Zettels, forming a complex, interconnected web. The links between Zettels are not merely hierarchical but associative, allowing for a multi-dimensional information organisation. This interconnectedness enables users to follow a trail of thought or inquiry in multiple directions, much like a neural network (Schmidt, 2014).

        In practice, Zettels can be used to build upon existing knowledge. When a new piece of information is encountered that is related to a topic with an existing Zettel, it can be linked to the existing Zettel. This creates a dense network of interconnected ideas, theories, and data points over time. The Zettelkasten method thus allows for the incremental building of a knowledge base, where each new Zettel enriches the existing network.

        For this thesis, the Zettelkasten method is particularly relevant as it embodies the principle of interconnectedness in a tangible form. It provides a working model for organising, linking, and building on complex sets of information to facilitate both depth and breadth of understanding. The method's emphasis on associative linking offers a practical approach to the theoretical concept of interconnectedness, making it a valuable case study for this project.
