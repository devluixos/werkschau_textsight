      <h3>Paper Prototype and Card Sorting: Findings</h3>
      <p>
        The implementation of paper prototype and card-sorting methodologies afforded a unique lens through which to observe and understand user interaction and cognitive processes in a rudimentary setting. While the task of connecting texts may appear straightforward initially, it poses its own set of challenges, requiring participants to draw upon their analytical and conceptual thinking skills to establish meaningful connections. Below is a summary of the findings from this test, which involved five participants, each bringing unique insights and approaches to the tasks at hand. The individual summarised interviews are in the appendix (B).
      </p>
      <p>
        Among them was a philosophy student known for his knack for abstract thinking, offering a conceptual and reflective approach to the tasks. Another participant, a law student, provided a logical and analytical perspective, reflecting the structured and disciplined nature of legal studies. Each participant’s unique approach and background enriched the study, revealing the diverse ways users interact and process information when connecting texts. Below is a summarised table of the findings from this prototype test:

            <td>1</td>
            <td>The participant focused on conceptual links, drawing parallels between overarching ideas and abstract themes, often overlooking the literal content.</td>

            <td>2</td>
            <td>Adopted a logical and structured approach, creating connections that were mostly single and simple, resembling hypertext links. The participant valued clear, straightforward links between texts, often based on clear content and logical coherence.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Prioritised visual and thematic links, emphasising the aesthetic and graphical representation of connections between texts. The participant suggested enhanced visual techniques, such as 3D visualisation, to represent the strength and depth of connections more effectively.</td>
            <td>Mixed</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Exhibited a balanced approach, combining various elements to establish connections between texts, similar to a Venn diagram. The participant merged texts that shared common topics, creating overlapping areas to represent shared themes or ideas.</td>

      <p>
        After the initial interaction with the texts, participants found themselves grappling with the ambiguity of a starting point or a root topic from which to base the visualisation. This initial phase of contemplation and analysis was pivotal, shaping the approach and perspective each participant adopted for the subsequent steps. The challenge was not in the lack of understanding of the texts but in conceptualising how to begin the visualisation process, highlighting the importance of clear guidelines or prompts in the final product to aid users in starting the visualisation process effectively.

      <p>
        Most participants opted to dissect the texts to unearth the underlying topics and their interrelations, rather than visualising the four notes of text as distinct entities. This segmentation of text allowed for a more nuanced and interconnected visualisation, focusing on the inherent correlations between the topics within the texts, and emphasising the importance of allowing users the flexibility to break down and rearrange texts in a manner that suits their cognitive processes and preferences.

      <p>
        In the card sorting exercise, there was a clear preference for simplistic and direct approaches to information retrieval and organisation, with participants predominantly leaning towards using topics or tags or employing a full-text search. The minimal utilisation of diverse filter methods indicates a user preference for straightforward and intuitive functionalities, suggesting that the final product should prioritise ease of use and accessibility in its features.
      </p>
      <img src="../assets/paper4.png" alt="Drawing with less filter methods" />
      <p>
        The emphasis during the visualisation process was notably on the nodes, representing the topics, rather than the lines or the overall visualisation structure. This focus on nodes as the primary units of information and connection underscores the importance of clear and distinct topic representation in the visualisation process. It also suggests that while the overall structure is important, users may prioritise understanding and interacting with individual elements within the structure.
      </p>
      <img src="../assets/paper5.png" alt="Wild labelled connections based on topics" />
      <p>
        The majority of participants chose a visualisation method involving circles for topics, connected by lines to symbolise relationships, emphasising the intuitive nature of this approach. A deviation was observed where a participant used circles similar to a Venn diagram, offering an alternative perspective on visual representation and topic correlation. These variations in visualisation strategies, from celestial representations to overlapping circles, underscore the importance of versatility in the final product. It should accommodate diverse user preferences, allowing users to represent information in ways that align with their cognitive and aesthetic inclinations, without compromising professionalism and clarity.

      <p>
        Another deviation did occur within this method. One participant introduced a celestial-themed visualisation, where topics were planets around a central star, and named entities were moons around their respective planets. The background nebula's colour in this visualisation varied to represent thematic connections between topics, serving as a visual cue for interconnected themes.
      </p>
      <h3>Critical Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        The lack of structured rules in the paper prototype posed a significant challenge for some participants. The boundless possibilities, while intended to foster creative thinking and diverse connection strategies, seemed to create a paradox of choice, making it difficult for some to conceptualise and establish meaningful connections between the texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participant's struggle to grasp the system and formulate connections underscores the importance of providing adequate guidance and structure in the final product, even as it maintains flexibility to accommodate diverse user preferences and approaches. This struggle was not just a reflection of the participant's conceptualisation abilities but also highlighted the inherent limitations of a paper prototype in simulating the dynamic and interactive nature of a digital environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The usability metrics integrated into the methodologies, such as task completion, learnability, and user satisfaction, generally indicated positive outcomes, suggesting that participants found the prototype engaging and useful. However, the error rate metric was rendered irrelevant in this context, given the non-applicability of errors in a paper prototype setting. This limitation in assessing error rates points to the need for more refined evaluation tools in subsequent testing phases.
      </p>
      <img src="../assets/paper7.png" alt="Usability metrics for the paper prototype" />
      <p>
        Moreover, the cognitive load metric revealed potential concerns, with indications of high cognitive demand placed on the participants. This could be attributed either to the inherent constraints of a paper prototype or to the intricate nature of the task at hand. The elevated cognitive load emphasises the need for intuitive and user-friendly design in the high-fidelity prototype to mitigate cognitive strain and enhance user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the general positivity reflected in the usability metrics, their overall utility in informing the design of the next prototype was somewhat limited. The insights gained were more indicative than diagnostic, providing a glimpse into user interaction and satisfaction but falling short of offering actionable data for specific design improvements.
