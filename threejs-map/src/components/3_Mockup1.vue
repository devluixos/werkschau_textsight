      <h2>Mock-up: Methodology and Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Building on the insights from the previous chapter, the next phase of development introduces a digital mock-up, a conceptual representation designed to further refine and enhance the user interaction and visualisation strategies of the prototype. The previous prototype showed several areas for improvement and refinement, particularly in user interaction and visualisation methods. It revealed a need for a balanced approach to meet diverse user preferences. This digital mock-up aims to address the identified shortcomings by focusing on advances visualisations and more interactive solutions. It will also shift away from the ‘one node per text’ model with varied forms of visual representations.
      </p>
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        The objectives of this mock-up are concentrated on enhancing the user interaction and experience with the AI generated visualisation. The goals are to refine the visualisation strategies, the user interaction and the aesthetic appeal.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refine visualisation strategies:</strong> To explore and implement advanced and diverse visualisation strategies, with dynamic and interactive visual elements that align with the users expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance user interaction:</strong> To refine interaction models and design concepts, focusing on intuitive navigation and user-friendly interfaces that facilitate seamless user engagement with the mock-up.</li>
        <li><strong>Asses user reception of advanced visual elements:</strong> To evaluate user perceptions to the newly implemented visual elements and interaction models. Identifying areas for further refinement.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimise aesthetic appeal and functionality:</strong> To enhance the aesthetic appeal of the mock-up while maintaining functional integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>User-centric evaluation:</strong> To conduct user-centric tests to gather insights on user preferences, behaviours and expectations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mock-up: Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure the final product aligns with user needs and expectations, a series of user-centric methodologies are employed, including interviews, user tests, customer journey map, and empathy map. Summaries of the interviews can be found in the appendix (D).

      <p>
        The process begins with a briefing of the tester on the mock-up, ensuring they have a clear understanding of its functionalities and objectives. This briefing helps to set the stage for the subsequent user test, providing the tester with the necessary context to interact with the prototype effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the briefing, user tests are conducted, adhering to a predefined script referenced in the appendix (G). These tests are directly integrated with interviews, creating a rich source of information where users can interact with the prototype and concurrently articulate their thought processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To evaluate the feedback effectively, the following methods are used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer journey map:</strong> These will visualise the users experience with the mock-up, highlighting the different stages of interactions and pinpoint areas of improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy Map:</strong> Developed to gain a deeper insight into user needs and preferences, these maps will categorise user responses, thoughts and feelings, providing a comprehensive view of the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Discussion:</strong> To learn what the participants opinions and feelings about the mock-up, an open discussion follows the test. This enables the possibility to gather deep insights into the users thought processes and experiences.</li>
      </ul>
