      <h3>Summary of Main Insights</h3>
      <h4>Prototype Development</h4>
      <p>
        The necessity for granular navigation and a diverse, user-friendly visualisation strategy was a key finding. It emphasises the importance of specific user preferences. This insight partially answers the first sub-question by illustrating how the design of AI-driven visualisations can be optimised. The exploration from Chapter 3 demonstrated the balance between depth of analysis, speed and efficiency, implying the importance of selecting the appropriate model. Whether it will be a statistical model with NLP, LLM or a combination, will be part of the practical thesis.

      <p>
        The broad range of possible applications received positive feedback. This reaffirms the project's potential impact.

      <h4>Visualisation Strategies</h4>
      <p>
        This thesis is built on the exploration and application of visualisation techniques, which provide clear guidelines for integrating dynamic and user-centric features. A consistent desire for more sophisticated and diverse visual elements emerged, guiding further exploration to meet a variety of aesthetic preferences. The significance of user-centric design and selective presentation became clear. Different themes as seen in Chapter 3.4 could be enhanced with personal and customisable building blocks to represent data. Clear guidelines and structured support are critical for assisting users during initial interactions while maintaining flexibility for diverse user approaches. This addresses the second sub-question regarding the functional elements and design principles. The emphasis is on ease of use, supporting functionalities that provide transparency and customisation while allowing users to tailor the system to their specific needs and preferences.

      <h4>AI and Text Analysis</h4>
      <p>
        The conceptual exploration in this area highlighted the complexity but also guides the way for further refinement of the process. The system has to adapt to the rapid advancements in the field of AI. The text can not only be analysed with simple lists of keywords and named entities. The implementation of a probability score to quantify interconnectedness and relationships within texts emerged as a complex but detrimental part of the thesis. This will allow the system to be far more specific in displaying and creating connections, in contrast to the created prototypes. Such a score can give weight to key points in texts, creating the possibility for further filters, connections and specifications from the user. The utilisation of the probability score contributes to answering the research question of how the visualisation of connections between bits of information can be enhanced with AI.

      <h4>Expert Interview Insights</h4>
      <p>
        The dialogue with Yaniv Steiner provided insights into data analysis, visualisation and the development possibilities. It displayed the importance of refining information extraction to achieve depth, granularity and accuracy in data points. The discussion on visualisation strategies underscored the need for clarity with a selective presentation of detailed connections.
