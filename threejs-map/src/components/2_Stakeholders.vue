      <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>
        In order to further understand the project's direction, it is crucial to understand the needs and
        pain points of the stakeholders. These stakeholders - students, educators, researchers,
        professionals and frequent writers - are selected based on their intricate relationship with
        information, particularly textual data. They are all engaged with synthesising and making sense of
        various forms of information.

        Students, often operating on limited budgets, navigate a complex academic landscape filled with
        articles, videos, and interactive platforms. One of the biggest obstacles they have to overcome is
        making sense of all this data and obtaining useful insights for research without breaking the bank.
        In the academic setting, educators act as guides, helping students and researchers through the
        maze of available material. Their task is to effectively assist students in navigating and analysing
        this knowledge, allowing them to create meaningful connections between disparate information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Researchers stand at the forefront of knowledge creation. Their work involves not just the
        consumption but also the synthesis of information from diverse sources. This includes scholarly
        articles and raw experimental data. The need for tools that can assist in visualising and
        interpreting this complex landscape is a constant requirement, particularly in the context of
        academic research or personal knowledge management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionals, such as project managers, face unique challenges. Their roles often require making
        decisions based on extensive, multidisciplinary research. The ability to effectively visualise and
        integrate every piece of information into their project strategy is not an option but a necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frequent Writers include individuals like bloggers, business analysts, and technical writers. They
        distil large volumes of information into coherent narratives or reports. Tools that aid in organisation and visualisation are invaluable to them as they juggle multiple writing tasks
        requiring quick combination and display of information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The importance of identifying these stakeholders arises from their potential to influence the
        project's direction and impact. For example, studentâ€™s price sensitivity could drive a use case for a
        free-to-use application, whereas researchers and professionals needs could shape functions that
        aid in research or personal knowledge management.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, the stakeholder landscape is diverse but shares core challenges around the effective
        visualisation of textual data. Addressing these challenges is pivotal for shaping the project's
        direction and ensuring its impact.
