      <h2>3. Methodology, Findings and Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter outlines the research process, conducted through an iterative, user-centred approach that aligns with the ISO 9241-210 standard for human-centred design (Jacobsen & Meyer, 2022). The ISO 9241-210 standard outlines principles and activities that aim to make a system more usable, focusing on optimising the user's experience and ensuring that user needs and limitations are at the forefront throughout the design and development process.

        The methodology employed in this research involved a cyclical process of interviews, data analysis, prototype implementation, and user testing. Each cycle aimed to refine the research focus and improve the prototype based on real-world user feedback and needs. This approach ensures that the research is both targeted and expansive, offering a comprehensive understanding of the user experience in the realms of note-taking, technology, and AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each subchapter in this chapter is structured to reflect one iteration of this cycle, encompassing the methodology, findings, and evaluation for either an interview session or a prototype test. The findings section will present the data and insights gathered, and the evaluation section will offer a critical assessment of these findings, discussing their implications and suggesting future directions for research. This structure allows for a detailed, step-by-step understanding of how each iteration contributed to the research objectives.

      <h3>3.1. Interviews: Methodology and Findings</h3>
      <p>
        The interviews were conducted online, each lasting between 30 to 45 minutes, using a semi-open format. This approach combined structured, predetermined questions with the flexibility for open-ended discussions. The structured questions were designed to touch upon each facet of the User Experience Honeycomb model (UXPin, 2022), which includes:

      <p>
        This model served as a guiding framework to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the user experience, particularly in the realms of note-taking, technology, and AI.

      <h4>3.1.1. Objectives</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>To understand the strategies employed by individuals for taking notes and how these notes are used post-creation.</li>
        <li>To identify the types of tools, platforms, and software used in the note-taking and data management process.</li>
        <li>To explore the challenges and limitations individuals face in their current note-taking methods.</li>
        <li>To assess the participant’s openness to the use of AI in note-taking and data management.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The four participants for these interviews were carefully selected from a diverse student body, representing various academic fields. This selection strategy was intentional, aiming to capture a broad spectrum of experiences and perspectives on note-taking, technology use, and attitudes toward AI. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, all interviews were recorded and transcribed. These transcriptions were then analysed to identify common themes, challenges, and opportunities, which subsequently informed the design and development of solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's worth noting that the interviews had their limitations. The scope was confined to the participant’s experiences in academic settings and their interactions with AI, which were considered during the analysis phase to contextualise the findings appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
        The insights gained from these interviews serve as foundational data for the development of the first prototype. The plan is to engage the same interviewees, along with additional participants, in the testing and validation of this prototype, thereby ensuring continuity and reliability in the research process.
