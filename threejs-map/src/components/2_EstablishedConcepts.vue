      <h2>Established Concepts and Practices</h2>
      <p>
        The technical evolution has immensely affected how we organise, access, and even conceptualise information (Mutsaers et al., 1998). Various techniques have been created to solve the new challenges. Each takes a different approach, but they all centre on the interconnection of information. This idea is a structural feature as well as a cognitive tool. It allows for networked thinking, in which accessing one piece of knowledge leads to discovering related concepts. This improves comprehension and problem-solving abilities (Alhadad, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each methodology provides a distinct viewpoint on interconnectedness. They assist users in creating structures that expose the underlying connections between data components. This thesis intends to demonstrate how to use connections for improved knowledge management by examining these.
      </p>
      <h3>Hypertext</h3>
      <p>
        The term "hypertext" was coined by Ted Nelson in the 1960s, as discussed in Smith & Weiss (1988). Its conceptual foundation can be traced back to Vannevar Bush's idea of "the memex" in 1945. This device was designed to emulate the associative structure of human memory (Vannevar Bush, 1945). Unlike traditional, linear documents, hypertext enables a complex, networked organisation of information. Each node in this network can store various data types, ranging from text and graphics to audio and video. As a result, hypertext becomes an interactive and dynamic tool for discovering information (Smith & Weiss, 1988). Hypertext has transformed the way we handle and interact with information in digital contexts. It enables real-time updates and dynamic linking, making it a foundational internet technology. Because of its adaptability and flexibility, its uses have expanded beyond online browsing to academic research, software development, and other industries requiring difficult information management.

      <p>
        In the context of this thesis, hypertext is a key example of how interconnectedness can be used for effective knowledge management. Its non-linear, dynamic structure provides a paradigm for organising and linking similar pieces of information. It contains the interrelated proposals that this thesis seeks to investigate and provides a practical framework for the various approaches presented.

      <h3>Zettelkasten by Niklas Luhmann</h3>
      <p>
        The Zettelkasten method, conceived by Niklas Luhmann, is a sophisticated system for knowledge management that involves creating "Zettels," or atomic notes, for individual pieces of information (Tietze, 2013). Each Zettel is a self-contained unit of knowledge but is also linked to other Zettels, forming a complex, interconnected web. The links between Zettels are not merely hierarchical but associative, allowing for a multi-dimensional information organisation. This interconnectedness enables users to follow a trail of thought or inquiry in multiple directions, much like a neural network (Schmidt, 2014).
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, Zettels can be used to build upon existing knowledge. When a new piece of information is encountered that is related to a topic with an existing Zettel, it can be linked to the existing Zettel. This creates a dense network of interconnected ideas, theories, and data points over time. The Zettelkasten method thus allows for the incremental building of a knowledge base, where each new Zettel enriches the existing network.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this thesis, the Zettelkasten method is particularly relevant as it embodies the principle of interconnectedness in a tangible form. It provides a working model for organising, linking, and building on complex sets of information to facilitate both depth and breadth of understanding. The method's emphasis on associative linking offers a practical approach to the theoretical concept of interconnectedness, making it a valuable case study for this project.

      <h3>Second Brain by Tiago Forte</h3>
      <p>
        Tiago Forte's Second Brain methodology serves as an external digital repository for ideas and insights. The system operates on a four-step process known as CODE: Capture, Organise, Distil, and Express (Forte, 2023a). For instance, imagine a research paper on hypertext. The key points are captured in a digital note, which is then organised by tagging it under categories like "Hypertext Studies" or "Digital Information Management." Over time, these notes are reviewed and distilled into their most essential forms, perhaps summarising the key findings of the hypertext paper. Finally, the distilled information is expressed in a new Zettel, integrating these findings with other related research, possibly leading to a thesis chapter on hypertext.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forte uses three note-taking styles from Le Cunff (2020) and adds the student to them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Gardener:</strong> This personality cultivates ideas, allowing them to grow organically and connect. They maintain a dynamic knowledge ecosystem.</li>
        <li><strong>The Architect:</strong> Architects carefully structure their knowledge, creating frameworks and systems. They prioritise order and hierarchy.</li>
        <li><strong>The Librarian:</strong> This type focuses on cataloguing and organising information for easy retrieval and access.</li>
        <li><strong>The Student:</strong> This group is still in the process of developing a distinct style and serves more as a utility category (Forte, 2022).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While these personalities are not directly integrated into this project, they will be used for analysing interviewees to understand their information management styles. The Gardener approach is especially relevant to this project because it emphasizes the organic growth and interconnectedness of ideas, which aligns closely with the project's objectives. The Student category serves as a placeholder for those still developing their information management style. The Second Brain's CODE methodology is particularly useful for this project, offering a structured yet flexible approach to transforming raw data into actionable insights (Forte, 2023b).

      <h3>Obsidian</h3>
      <p>
        Obsidian is a free note-taking tool that matches the project's goals, particularly its emphasis on networked thought via bi-directional links and atomic notes. While several note-taking apps were explored, Obsidian stood out due to its unique features and freeware status, which increases its accessibility for the primary stakeholders: students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can create and explore intricate webs of connections between different data points thanks to the application's focus on bi-directional links. This promotes an understanding of information, where the value extends beyond individual notes up to the complex network they form. Obsidian also supports a variety of plugins and markdown features, which expands its capabilities for managing complex information.
      </p>
      <img src="../assets/Figure8.png" alt="Example of bi-directional linking" />
      <p><strong>Figure</strong></p>
      <p><em>Example of bi-directional linking</em></p>
      <p>
        It's important to note that Obsidian's interconnectedness approach may present a learning curve for new users. However, the software's capabilities make it worth the investment in learning time. One avenue for this project could be the development of an Obsidian plugin. This would leverage Obsidian's existing features, avoiding the need to reinvent foundational elements and allowing for a focus on building specialised functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, Obsidian serves as a dynamic knowledge base well-suited for this project. Its features, especially bi-directional links and atomic notes, align with the project's emphasis on organic growth and the interconnectedness of ideas. Its freeware status further adds to its suitability, making it a practical choice for this research (Obsidian, 2023).

      <h3>Implications for the Project</h3>
      <p>
        The insights gained from the theories and methods presented in this chapter are essential for the project's design and implementation. The focus lies on interconnectedness, user-centric design, and data visualisation. The findings are depicted in the following image - Dynamic Knowledge Landscape, Holistic Visualisation, and Granularity with Connectivity - demonstrate the project's alignment with its objectives.
      </p>

      <p>
        The incorporation of these ideas aims to create a theoretically stable, effective, and adaptive tool for efficiently managing and visualising interrelated data. The system is intended to help nodes grow organically, adapt to new inputs, and evolve over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        More specifically, it tries to offer a multi-dimensional organisation with a depth and breadth of information via bi-directional links between nodes. This strategy assures a user-centric emphasis by providing practical solutions that promote knowledge management and data visualisation.
