      <h4>Implications for the Project</h4>
      <p>
        The insights gained from the theories and methods presented in this chapter are essential for the project's design and implementation. The focus lies on interconnectedness, user-centric design, and data visualisation. The findings are depicted in the following image - Dynamic Knowledge Landscape, Holistic Visualisation, and Granularity with Connectivity - demonstrate the project's alignment with its objectives.

        The incorporation of these ideas aims to create a theoretically stable, effective, and adaptive tool for efficiently managing and visualising interrelated data. The system is intended to help nodes grow organically, adapt to new inputs, and evolve over time.

        More specifically it tries to offer a multi-dimensional organisation with a depth and breadth of information via bi-directional links between nodes. This strategy assures a user-centric emphasis by providing practical solutions that promote knowledge management and data visualisation.
