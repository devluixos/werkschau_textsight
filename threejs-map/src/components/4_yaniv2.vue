      <h4>Interconnectedness and Probability</h4>
      <p>
        In the dialogue about interconnectedness within the system, the concept of calculating a ‘score’ to determine the level of connection between entities was discussed. It was agreed that referring to this as 'probability' would be more appropriate, as it would provide a clearer representation of the likelihood of connections between different entities. The initial exploration of named entities would be carried out using statistical NLP models, which serve as a base layer for identifying and analysing the entities present in the data. Following that, LLM would be used to explore deeper into the contextual data, uncovering relationships and connections that statistical models alone may not reveal.

        The discussion then moved on to the processing chain or how the system should adapt and respond to new input. While it was acknowledged that this is an important aspect of the system's design, the discussion of the intricate technical details of this process was considered premature at the current prototype stage. The emphasis remained on understanding the broader implications and potential approaches to effectively integrating new inputs, with finer technicalities addressed in later stages of development.
