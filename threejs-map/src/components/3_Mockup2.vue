      <h1>Mockup</h1>
      <h2>Mock-up: Methodology and Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Building on the insights from the previous chapter, the next phase of development introduces a digital mock-up, a conceptual representation designed to further refine and enhance the user interaction and visualisation strategies of the prototype. The previous prototype showed several areas for improvement and refinement, particularly in user interaction and visualisation methods. It revealed a need for a balanced approach to meet diverse user preferences. This digital mock-up aims to address the identified shortcomings by focusing on advances visualisations and more interactive solutions. It will also shift away from the ‘one node per text’ model with varied forms of visual representations.
      </p>
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        The objectives of this mock-up are concentrated on enhancing the user interaction and experience with the AI generated visualisation. The goals are to refine the visualisation strategies, the user interaction and the aesthetic appeal.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refine visualisation strategies:</strong> To explore and implement advanced and diverse visualisation strategies, with dynamic and interactive visual elements that align with the users expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance user interaction:</strong> To refine interaction models and design concepts, focusing on intuitive navigation and user-friendly interfaces that facilitate seamless user engagement with the mock-up.</li>
        <li><strong>Asses user reception of advanced visual elements:</strong> To evaluate user perceptions to the newly implemented visual elements and interaction models. Identifying areas for further refinement.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimise aesthetic appeal and functionality:</strong> To enhance the aesthetic appeal of the mock-up while maintaining functional integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>User-centric evaluation:</strong> To conduct user-centric tests to gather insights on user preferences, behaviours and expectations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mock-up: Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure the final product aligns with user needs and expectations, a series of user-centric methodologies are employed, including interviews, user tests, customer journey map, and empathy map. Summaries of the interviews can be found in the appendix (D).
      </p>
      <p>
        The process begins with a briefing of the tester on the mock-up, ensuring they have a clear understanding of its functionalities and objectives. This briefing helps to set the stage for the subsequent user test, providing the tester with the necessary context to interact with the prototype effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the briefing, user tests are conducted, adhering to a predefined script referenced in the appendix (G). These tests are directly integrated with interviews, creating a rich source of information where users can interact with the prototype and concurrently articulate their thought processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To evaluate the feedback effectively, the following methods are used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer journey map:</strong> These will visualise the users experience with the mock-up, highlighting the different stages of interactions and pinpoint areas of improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy Map:</strong> Developed to gain a deeper insight into user needs and preferences, these maps will categorise user responses, thoughts and feelings, providing a comprehensive view of the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Discussion:</strong> To learn what the participants opinions and feelings about the mock-up, an open discussion follows the test. This enables the possibility to gather deep insights into the users thought processes and experiences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mock-up: Findings</h3>
      <p>
        The analysis of the interviews has brought forth multiple insights and areas in need of improvement. The interaction and usability of the mock-up was the initial focal point for most participants. Participant 1 interacted intuitively with the prototype, suggesting a positive user experience. However, participant 2 struggled with the provided visualisations and the interaction elements due to the mock-ups static nature. 
        Participants 4 and 5 expressed concerns about the unconventional navigation system, suggesting a need for a more intuitive navigation to enhance user interaction. The empathy map below provides a visual representation of the collective experiences, thoughts and feelings of the participants.

      <p>
        Participants recognised the prototypes versatility and its potential to transform various disciplines by enhancing data interpretation, visual expression and communication. However, participant 5 questioned the practical value of the prototype and its ability to meet the diverse needs of its intended users. He emphasised the importance of individuality and adaptability in the prototypes implementation. The user journey map (appendix E) illustrates the participants interactions, goals, challenges and opportunities at different stages of engagement with the mock-up. This provides a holistic view of the user experience and potential areas for improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants provided valuable suggestions centred around enhancing visual elements and refining the navigation. The need for more detailed and diverse visual elements as well as artistic options was emphasised to allow for a more tailored user experience. The importance of a user-friendly navigation and structure was consistently highlighted.
      </p>
      <h3>Critical Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        The users generally interacted positively with the mock-up, appreciating the design and simple interaction possibilities. This was the aim of this iteration, to optimise the user interaction and the visualisation strategies. However, the static nature of the mock-up, inherent due to the conceptual stage of a Figma prototype, posed challenges for the participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mock-up, being a conceptual representation, did not have full functionality implemented. This was understood to be a limitation in this phase of development and testing. This static nature required participants to imagine the dynamic visualisation and interaction with it, which increased the cognitive load on them during the evaluations. This mental simulation of browsing through dynamic pieces of information floating around a planet impacted the fluidity of their experience and their feedback.
      </p>

      <p><em>Clickable mock-up with planetary layout</em></p>

      <p>
        More impressions of the prototype can be found in the appendix (F). Despite these challenges, the test was constructive. It highlighted the need for more intricate and especially dynamic visual elements for the user to click, drag and play around with. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The feedback concerning the navigation was mostly positive, while the unusual nature was a little off-putting for the participants with UI and UX experience. The need for a navigation with enhanced filtering options is present, but they would value a softer learning curve to get started with such a system.
      </p>
      <h3>Summary and Key Insights</h3>
      <p>
        The development of the mock-up was primarily centred around refining user interaction. The insights obtained from the prototype highlight the need for advancements in navigation and interaction models to meet user preferences. The prototype, which split up the texts instead of using a 'one node per text' approach, revealed a necessity for more dynamic and user-aligned visualisation strategies with interactive elements. Aesthetic elements and functionality need enhancements to balance visual appeal with technical robustness. These user-centric evaluations are essential, illuminating areas for refinement and emphasising the importance of closely aligning the prototype with user needs and expectations.
