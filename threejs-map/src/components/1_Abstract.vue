        <span class="bold">TextSight</span> looks into the use of artificial intelligence to visualise the connections between bits of
        information. It addresses the practical interpretation of large amounts of textual data. The central
        research question asks how AI-driven insights can improve the visualisation of interconnected
        information. The focus lies on user-centric design methodologies. The thesis research branches
        out into existing visualisation studies, AI models and their applications. It also includes ethical
        considerations and technical challenges such as data privacy and bias.

        The project followed a user-centred iterative approach that started with interviews and multiple
        rounds of prototype creation, improvement and testing. Multiple visualisation options were
        developed to explore the possibilities further. Interviews, paper prototypes and card sorting were
        among the methodologies used to gather stakeholder insights.

        A key discovery is the implementation of a probability score. This score measures the
        interconnectedness of texts, which will aid in developing user-centred filters and specifications.
        The findings focus on the importance of aligning technical possibilities with user preferences by
        enabling the user to customise and personalise the visualisations to support more user-specific
        needs.

        The goal of this project is to change how users handle and navigate through data by providing a
        system that can offer a holistic overview while allowing to dynamically filter and zoom into
        specific topics for the desired use case.
