      <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
      <p>
        The practical thesis will focus on the development of this tool. Given the challenges, as mentioned before, multiple expert interviews have been planned.
      </p>
      <h3>Expert interviews: Data Design & Art</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is to gather more information about 3D visualisation and presentation of information. To create the visualisations, the author needs to gather the knowledge and skill to create them.
      </p>
      <h3>Expert interviews: Computer Science</h3>
      <p>
        The implementation itself will need to be constructed in a robust and efficient fashion. These interviews should provide the author with the state of the art knowledge about software architecture and modern software development.
      </p>
      <h3>Development and Iteration</h3>
      <p>
        The project’s development will continue in a similar fashion: implementing a functional prototype, testing and gathering feedback, analyzing and improving, and testing again. This circular methodology has proven reliable and the involvement of stakeholders reassured the project’s goals.
      </p>
      <h3>Long-term Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond the immediate development and refinement phase, the project hopes to evolve and adapt to the changing landscapes of data visualisation and software development. Continuous learning and adaptation will be necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The long-term vision is to release a free, open-source project which can be improved and refined by the community using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope of just textual data will remain initially, but if the technology allows the inclusion of different forms of media it will be added to the functionalities.
